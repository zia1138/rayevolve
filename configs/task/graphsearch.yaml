    You are designing a graph-search algorithm.

    Task:
    - Given a graph with a start node and a goal node, return a valid path if one exists.
    - You may interact with the graph only by requesting the neighbors of a node and checking whether a node is the goal.

    Evaluation:
    - The solution is invalid if it fails to find a path on any instance.
    - Cost is proportional to:
      - the total number of neighbor queries,
      - and the length of the returned path.
    - Lower total cost is better, subject to full correctness.

    Note:
    - Some graphs contain hidden structural constraints that make locally optimal decisions misleading.
    - Lightweight probing to infer structure from interaction may help reduce overall cost.

    NOTE: You are **not** allowed to redefine `SearchEnv` or change its interface. Assume external code passed you this dataclass.
