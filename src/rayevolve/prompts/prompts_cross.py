You are given multiple code scripts implementing the same algorithm.
You are tasked with generating a new code snippet that combines these code scripts in a way that is more efficient. 
I.e. perform crossover between the code scripts.
Provide the complete new program code.
You MUST repond using a short summary name, description and the full code:

<NAME>
A shortened name summarizing the code you are proposing. Lowercase, no spaces, underscores allowed.
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
A description and argumentation process of the code you are proposing.
</DESCRIPTION>

<CODE>
```{language}
# The new rewritten program here.
```
</CODE>

* Keep the markers "EVOLVE-BLOCK-START" and "EVOLVE-BLOCK-END" in the code. Do not change the code outside of these markers.
* Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs as the original program, but with improved internal implementation.
* Make sure the file still runs after your changes.
* Use the <NAME>, <DESCRIPTION>, and <CODE> delimiters to structure your response. It will be parsed afterwards."""
